# HPL
A language for programming human organizational systems.
HPL is not a computer or spoken language. It is instead a format of writing and collection of principles to help streamline processes and reduce onboarding costs of new human resources.

An HPL program is written by an HPL programmer who develops roles and processes for humans. It is the job of the HPL programmer to identify errors in the system, create improvements to the system, and to ensure humans are updated with the new instance of their role.

## Values
A set of corporate values used by the HPL programmer to help build the processes. This is documentation used only by the programmer to help with decision making regarding __how__ processes should run.

## Guidelines
Guidelines outline the overarching rules the HPL programmer needs to abide by when creating processes. This is documentation used only by the programmer 

## Roles
A human can identify if work is outside their role by checking to see if they have any applicable processes

## Processes
If no process exists for a certain event it is up to the HPL programmer to analyze what happened to the organization and write a process for the correct roles to deal with it

## Process guidelines
A process can have it's own guidelines. A good HPL programmer will merge as many of the process guidelines into 

## HPL Programmer
The mastermind. The architect. The guy you blame if the organization is inefficient. The guy you love when he boosts your profits by 20%

## Orchestrator
A role which has processes that manage other roles

## Human
Humans are instances of roles. Whenever you create a change to a roles process you need to update the humans who have created an instance of that role.
The job of a human is to complete tasks by executing processes associated with their role.
